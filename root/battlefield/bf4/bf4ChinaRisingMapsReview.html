			The map starts out at the break of dawn and soon becomes day.I've always been partial to maps that take place in low light conditions, because I don't have to put up with Supernova Sun.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is plenty of vehicle and infantry combat. Taking out choppers with tanks, rooftop combat at B flag is something I enjoy a lot. After the levolution event, some underground tunnels become accessible, which can be used by infantry to navigate between capture points. This provides multiple flanking routes - sign of a well designed map.
		</p>
		<p>
			The MAA's existence has been questioned on this map, but I think skilled chopper pilots can navigate through the maps taking cover behind buildings. What I never understood was why jets exist on this map, other than to ram attack choppers.

		<p>
			This map set in a Chinese village, and it is a paradise for rooftop campers and little bird pilots, with plenty of tall buildings to choose from to either set up shop or take cover from stinger missiles. As much as everyone likes to hate rooftop campers, I think its a viable strategy if used correctly. I found that the best ways to counter those who are perched on the roof is by using either the XM25 Airburst or the transport chopper.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is one of those maps where the levolution really changes the ground combat. Once the event is triggered, the center of the map is flooded, and this allows for some great RHIB gameplay.
		</p>
		<p>
			Flood Zone mainly caters to infantry combat. The area around B and C flag is a maze and success requires good map knowledge. This is an excellent example of a 64 player map with vertical gameplay done right.

	<!-- GUILIN PEAKS -->

		<a><h2>Guilin Peaks</h2></a>

		<p>
			Tanks, jets, choppers, MAAs, M142, and jeeps - all make an appearance here. This is one for the old school Battlefield players.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a lot of infantry combat around the A, B and C flags. This part of the map is like a Bad Company 2 map in itself. One could play an entire round of conquest and not venture away from this area. Vehicles dominate the rest of the map and snipers looking to get that 1000m headshot, and not help the team in the process, can camp far away in the hills.
		</p>
		<p>
			D flag on this map is actually the train itself, which moves from one side of the map to the other depending on which team is holding the flag. I think they should have allowed players to navigate within the train carts, but sadly that is not possible. It is however possible to run on top of the carts, Indiana Jones style!

		<p>
			The highlight of this map is of course the resort in the center. The levolution event involves demolishing different sections of the resort. Once triggered, a section collapses, and so does the game performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frame rate could dip below 20 FPS, and the collapsed section of the map is plagued by invisible walls.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I love the concept, and the ambitious design, I cannot ignore the problems. A patch released by DICE Sweden was supposed to have addressed some of the issues, but it seems to have made little to no difference. This map is a wasted opportunity in my opinion.
