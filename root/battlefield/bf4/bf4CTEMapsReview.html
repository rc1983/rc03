			I had a lot of fun on this map, but I feel this map would not have been liked by the community especially if it was played in Normal Mode. 3D spotting would absolutely ruin the experience.

			It is a very interesting take on this map, but I can understand why this was never released. It was a fun experiment. I had a lot of fun playing it in CTE in classic mode, but it was clear to me that it wouldn't work very well out in the public.

There were talks about removing access to the high rises, and I felt that was a bad choice because its the high rises that seperate Siege of Shanghai from any random urban map. I couldn't wait to play in the center tower at night.
