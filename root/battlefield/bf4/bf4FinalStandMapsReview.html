			This map is set in Karelia, presumably the Russian part of the region. It somewhat deviates from the theme of the expansion and presents us with a lot of greenery. This is a vehicle heavy map, with all major vehicles included. Sort of reminds me of Golmud Railway, which is always a good thing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The center capture point is set inside a mech factory, with lots of lanes, and plenty of places to hide, and an opportunity for some interesting vertical gameplay. I love playing here as an agressive recon. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of the map is vehicle heavy. It is also a good map for attack choppers. I've had a lot of good rounds as a tanker, gunner and AA. I am glad they included the AA, but there is only one on the map, which spawns near the center. This becomes a much contested capture point in the beginning because of this. If the enemy team has a good attack chopper pilot, and they manage to get the AA, it can be tough.

			This is one of my absolute favorite maps in the entire Battlefield series, not just Battlefield 4. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The complex level design in the hangar bay, the launch pods, snow covered mountain with the hangar inside it...its like a Bond movie. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I would never miss an opportunity to play this map, even though there are design choices that are extremely annoying. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Just like Dawnbreaker, I am not sure why jets exist on this map other than to the attack chopper. Speaking of which, there is only one attack chopper on this map, and it spawns out in the open. I am fine with this because its risk vs. reward, however, because of the map layout, it is much easier to seek cover as one team compared to the other. The team that spawns closer to the mountain does not have as much cover for the attack chopper. Not sure why DICE would design the map in this manner. Also, enemy jets can follow the attack chopper all the way to their base. The stationary AA hardly seems to bother jets. Poor design of map boundaries in my opinion. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I hadly ever played this map for vehicles but for the infantry combat in the hangar bay. Its so well desgined. The three capture points near the mountain can be their own map! It allows for so many different kinds of gameplay choices. Also, triggering the titan launch and killing enemies trying to make their way into the hanger from below is a lot of fun. 
		</p>
		<p>
			DICE have delivered a fantastic expansion as their final premium DLC.
