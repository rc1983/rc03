			This is it. The best map in the game. What a way to close the Battlefield 4 chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was worried that DICE would pick an infantry map for this expansion. The open poll results had me a little worried because Grand Bazaar and Noshar Canals got a whole lot of votes. I do not think those are bad maps, I just did not want them remade because I could easily find servers with those maps in rotation. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, DICE had the right idea in mind when they decided that for Legacy Operations, they would pick a map from Battlefield 2. I felt that most of the maps from the game would work well because by and large, we did not have Metro like maps in that game. Strike at Karkand actually won the poll, and I would not have been unhappy with a reimagined version of it. In hindsight, they made the a choice by not going with it because Dargon Valley 2015 turned out to be a fantastic map.

			I am not even sure where to begin describing this massive map. There is a large scale vehicle gameplay, and but there is also plenty to do for infantry. It just goes to show how well they designed it. There are 8 flag points on this map! It is the ideal Battlefield map for me. Sniping is a very viable on this map. The TDM version of this map is a reimagined version of Noshar Canals from Battlefield 3. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As I wait for Battlefield 2018 to be revealed, I am hoping DICE can make a game with more maps like this.
