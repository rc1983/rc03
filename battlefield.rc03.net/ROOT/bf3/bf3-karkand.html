		<p>
			Amiens is set in a French city of the same name. Its a dense urban map which is great for infantry and vehicle combat. There is no air combat to be had here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The map looks fantastic with lots to do for all classes and therefore is a fan favorite - of course, a fan favorite does not necessarily mean the map is any good (Ex - Operation Metro), but in this case, it reamins one of the best maps in all of Battlefield 1. Comparatively, there are more flanking routes available, and therefore getting spawn camped is not a common occurence. That said, I've had a few rounds where my team got trapped on one side of the map when the enemy team took control of both C & D objectives. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The behemoth on this map is the train, and unlike most maps, the behemoth can be useful here. It allows the losing team to capture points C & D and break the stalemate. That said, it really depends on how good the driver is. Some drivers tend to camp on the edge of the map and use the mortar instead of driving over to the capture points. Its neither DICE's fault that some choose to do this, nor is it a short coming of this map. Its just how things work on public servers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Amiens is a great map and its a real shame that the design principles of this map were not applied to all urban maps.

		<p>
			This is Battlefield 1's version of Operation Locker. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The map looks beautiful, and but the gameplay quickly devolves into fighting in choke points. I understand the appeal of this, but more often than not this design would lead to one sided games, and combine that with the awful scoring system in Battlefield 1, there are very few redeeming qualities with this map. The behemoth on this map is the train which run through the center capture point, and it can be very useful to clear the grid lock. However, more often than not, the team that is doing well, ends up destroying the behemoth and we are back to choke points. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Its a real shame that more wasn't done for this map. A few extra lanes, the ability to traverse over the hills would have helped the gameplay immensely. As it stands, it devolves into a explosive fest with one team spawn camping the other.

		<p>
			When I first heard about this map, I thought this was going to be a close quarters infantry map. Far from it, this is a well balanced map with plenty to do for vehicle players. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The center of attention is the palace. This provides excellent infantry gameplay. The outdoors are vast open areas, and not usually ideal for infantry play. There are a couple of points on either side that are meant to be captured by vehicles, because they have direct line of sight from the center of the map. I am generally not a fan of this form of design because it becomes very easy for the enemy team to close the gap and deny the capture point, unless the friendly team has a vehicle, and often times this is not the case. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Before the big cavalry nerf, it was a lot of fun playing as this class. Often times, I would flank around the side and make my way to the far capture point of the enemy team, and continue to harass them. This was a lot of fun, but once the nerf happened, this was not a viable strategy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I love the fact that all tank variants are available on this map because the best vehicle for the map varies depending on the situation. There are times when the enemy air is dominating, and stationary AA is not a viable alternative. Times like this, I go for the AA artillery truck.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sniping from the courtyard balcony is a lot of fun. Long range (Gewehr 98, M1903) and short range (SMLE, Arisaka) can be useful. This is one of those rare maps where more often than not, there are fun things to do.

		<p>
			This is my favorite map in Battlefield 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			It supports a lot of different kinds of gameplay, and on paper there is room for naval combat as well, but that aspect of Battlefield 1 is so underwhelming, its not even worth mentioning in my opinion. Even the Turning Tides DLC which was supposed to heavily focus on naval combat was boring at best in that aspect. Disregarding that though, there is plenty to do for everyone else. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is one of the most fun maps for long range sniping. Infantry has plenty to do between B, C, D, F capture points. Tanks can really shine on this map. It is especially fun taking out aircrafts with tanks. The behemoth on this map is the dreadnaught, and I found this particular behemoth to be the most boring. The gameplay devolves into slow and point and click adventure. Its only a step above the Commander mode in Battlefield 4. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The excellent gameplay, combined with the beautiful visuals make this one of the best Battlefield maps for me.

		<p>
			Yet another missed opportunity here. They could have turned the prison section from the single player campaign into a multiplayer map. The single player level had a huge outdoor area, but that's nowhere to be seen in Operation Locker.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interior has a whole section of prison cells spanning multiple levels near the C flag that are not playable. A couple of entry points from the outside into the C flag would have made this map so much better, and it could have still been appealing to those who like to play Battlefield: Call of Duty.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead they went for a linear choke point design, which is only marginally better than Operation Metro.

		<p>
			This is an absolutely beautiful map, with a great levolution event, but it is ruined by the Commander mode. Fortunately, I played on servers that turned off Commander mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			A & B points are crucial to winning the game. I am not so sure that the MAA should have been tied to point B. Given the location of the point, infantry will gather there anyway. There are other parts of the map that are relatively unpopulated. An MAA would be a great asset to fight for. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Naval combat is excellent on this map. Attack boats can be very powerful. Its a well balanced map for all kinds of gameplay.

		<p>
			The levolution event on this map is by far the best in Battlefield 4. It changes the map in many ways. The team controlling the tower has every reason to fight and make sure its not collapsed because it gives that team the ability to travel other capture points easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel this map is a great example of an urban battlefield. There is plenty of land combat and the attack boat is occasionally useful. I think this part of the gameplay was very under developed, but that didn't make the map less fun for me. Like most of the maps in the game, vertical gameplay is excellent. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Using a SRAW to take out a chopper from one of the rooftops is a great feeling.

		<p>
			The dish in the center of the map is the most distinctive feature of this map. Many epic Battlefield moments took place on and around this structure. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My main complaint with this map again is the fact that the gunship and MAA are tied to the same point like in Paracel Storm. Leveloution would result in invisible walls, just like in Hainan Resort.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than these two issues, the maps plays out extremely well more often than not.

		<p>
			Screwing up a map once is perhaps understandable, but how could they screw up the same map twice?? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Typically, we have seen one terrible map in the base game for each of the previous Battlefield titles. Battlefield 3 - Operation Metro, Battlefield 4 - Operation Locker, Battlefield Hardline - The Block, but Battlefield 1 went the extra mile and gave us two awful linear maps with very little redeeming qualities, with Suez being the map that went through a redesign and it was just as worse. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At launch this map had 3 capture points, and it was easily the worst map in the game. After several complaints, DICE attempted to fix this map, and all they did was add one more capture point to each side, and added a single transport vehicle. This did very little to address the gameplay, which largely revolves around C point. The behemoth (train) does little help because its far from the capture points, which is another baffling decision. The map looks beautiful with the shipwreck on side, but its inacessible and serves as nothing more than a pretty background. Once the enemy team gets a solid footing on C, its very difficult to make a combeback.
