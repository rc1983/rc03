	<h2>Battlefield 1 Update</h2>
	<p>
		I have not had the time to work on this project for the past few months, but I am not getting back into it. 

		I said that the next content update is going to be Battlefield 3 maps, but I decided to review Battlefield 1 instead.

	<h2>Bootstrap Update</h2>
	<p>
		With the v0.5 update, I have included bootstrap-3. While including JavaScript was not initially planned, I used it for the top nav, which I copied from bootstrap documentation, and slightly modified it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The next update is going to be a content update with Battlefield 3 maps.

	<h2>CSS Update</h2>
	<div class="content">
	<p>
		First major overhaul of this website. We went from using 100% HTML to now using rudimentary CSS. I spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with a consistent style for the entire website. It took a lot longer than I expected. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I will try to push another major update in a month.
