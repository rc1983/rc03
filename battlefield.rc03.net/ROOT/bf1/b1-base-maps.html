		<p>
			Amiens is set in a French city of the same name. Its a dense urban map which is great for infantry and vehicle combat. There is no air combat to be had here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The map looks fantastic with lots to do for all classes and therefore is a fan favorite - of course, a fan favorite does not necessarily mean the map is any good (Ex - Operation Metro), but in this case, it reamins one of the best baps in all of Battlefield 1. Comparitively, there are more flanking routes available, and therefore getting spawn camped is not a common occurence. That said, I've had a few rounds where my team got trapped on one side of the map when the enemy team took control of both C & D objectives. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The behemoth on this map is the train, and unlike most maps, the behemoth can be useful here. It allows the losing team to capture points C & D and break the stalemate. That said, it really depends on how good the driver is. Some drivers tend to camp on the edge of the map and use the mortar instead of driving over to the capture points. Its neither DICE's fault that some choose to do this, nor is it a short coming of this map. Its just how things work on public servers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Amiens is a great map and its a real shame that the design principles of this map were not applied to all urban maps.

		<p>
			This is Battlefield 1's version of Operation Locker. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The map looks beautiful, and but the gameplay quickly devolves into fighting in chokepoints. I understand the appeal of this, but more often than not this design would lead to one sided games, and combine that with the awful scoring system in Battlefield 1, there are very redeeming qualities with this map. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Its a real shame that more wasn't done for this map. A few extra lanes, the ability to traverse over the hills insteading of having to rely on

		<p>
			Tanks, jets, choppers, MAAs, M142, and jeeps - all make an appearance here. This is one for the old school Battlefield players.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a lot of infantry combat around the A, B and C flags. This part of the map is like a Bad Company 2 map in itself. One could play an entire round of conquest and not venture away from this area. Vehicles dominate the rest of the map and snipers looking to get that 1000m headshot, and not help the team in the process, can camp far away in the hills.
		</p>
		<p>
			D flag on this map is actually the train itself, which moves from one side of the map to the other depending on which team is holding the flag. I think they should have allowed players to navigate within the train carts, but sadly that is not possible. It is however possible to run on top of the carts, Indiana Jones style!

			The highlight of this map is of course the resort in the center. The levolution event involves demolishing different sections of the resort. Once triggered, a section collapses, and so does the game performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frame rate could dip below 20 FPS, and the collapsed section of the map is plagued by invisible walls.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I love the concept, and the ambitious design, I cannot ignore the problems. A patch released by DICE Sweden was supposed to have addressed some of the issues, but it seems to have made little to no difference. This map is a wasted opportunity in my opinion.

			Yet another missed opportunity here. They could have turned the prison section from the single player campaign into a multiplayer map. The single player level had a huge outdoor area, but that's nowhere to be seen in Operation Locker.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interior has a whole section of prison cells spanning multiple levels near the C flag that are not playable. A couple of entry points from the outside into the C flag would have made this map so much better, and it could have still been appealing to those who like to play Battlefield: Call of Duty.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead they went for a linear choke point design, which is only marginally better than Operation Metro.

		<p>
			This is an absolutely beautiful map, with a great levolution event, but it is ruined by the Commander mode. Fortunately, I played on servers that turned off Commander mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			A & B points are crucial to winning the game. I am not so sure that the MAA should have been tied to point B. Given the location of the point, infantry will gather there anyway. There are other parts of the map that are relatively unpopulated. An MAA would be a great asset to fight for. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Naval combat is excellent on this map. Attack boats can be very powerful. Its a well balanced map for all kinds of gameplay.

		<p>
			The dish in the center of the map is the most distinctive feature of this map. Many epic Battlefield moments took place on and around this structure. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My main complaint with this map again is the fact that the gunship and MAA are tied to the same point like in Paracel Storm. Leveloution would result in invisible walls, just like in Hainan Resort.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than these two issues, the maps plays out extremely well more often than not.

			The levolution event on this map is by far the best in Battlefield 4. It changes the map in many ways. The team controlling the tower has every reason to fight and make sure its not collapsed because it gives that team the ability to travel other capture points easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel this map is a great example of an urban battlefield. There is plenty of land combat and the attack boat is occasionally useful. I think this part of the gameplay was very under developed, but that didn't make the map less fun for me. Like most of the maps in the game, vertical gameplay is excellent. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Using a SRAW to take out a chopper from one of the rooftops is a great feeling.

		<p>
			Infantry combat at its best along with Flood Zone, but its more closer to my idea of a Battlefield map because of the presence of heavy armor. 
		</p>
		<p>
			While the destruction on this map is fantastic, it can lead to vehicles getting stuck on broken tree trunks, invisible walls between C & D flags.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is one of those rare maps that allow every class can be useful on this map provided the player goes for the objective.
