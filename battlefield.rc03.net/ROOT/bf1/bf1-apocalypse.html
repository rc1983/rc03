			This is an infantry only map  
		</p>
		<p>
			However, like all China Rising maps, Altai Range suffers from technical issues, and the Supernova Sun is back, because the community demands more lens flare. Making your way up the mountain from F flag to D flag is blinding, so its easy picking for snipers perched on top of the mountin. Not sure if adds anything other than frustration to the gameplay experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bomber is an interesting addition to the map, and in the hands of a good player, a kill is almost guaranteed. 
		</p>
		<p>
			All in all, solid vehicle based map, which needed a little bit more polish.

			DICE wasted an opportunity with here.  
		</p>
		<p>
			It could have been an amazing large scale map, but what we got was a total techincal mess. There are bugs and glitches everywhere, and they are not fixed to date. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Popping textures, concrete trees, bad geometry (invisible walls), transparent rocks, portals to limbo (falling through the map), its got everything! It makes me wonder how this map ever made it to release. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the technical problems with the map, it also suffers from some typical DICE design issues such as lack of cover on capture points which really undermines infantry combat. They also made the very bizzare decision to make the river very shallow on certain parts of the map, which leads to jet skis getting stuck - not sure what they were trying to accomplish here. For these reasons and more this map earns a well deserved F on my list.

			An excellent map, set in the Guilin Peaks, this is the first forest map in Battlefield 4. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There is not a lot to complain about here. The conquest large version of the map plays out pretty well, more often than not. I do not recollect many lopsided games on map because it is very easy to get out of the base and evade the enemies even if they manage to get close to the base. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The one thing I would have done differently is the placement of cover which allows campers to directly into the flag spawn area. A & E flag, for example, become open hunting grounds where friendlies can spawn within line of sight of the enemy quite easily. What little cover there is, can be destroyed, and this will lead to spawn killing.
		</p>
		<p>
			More often than not, this is not a problem in a 64p 1000 ticket game. It does eventually become a problem on higher ticket servers.

			This map is a paradise for snipers and tankers. Its one of the best vehicle based maps in the game. Presence of transport vehicles, especially the dirt bikes makes this map a lot of fun to play because they are perfect for using jeep stuff! 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a couple of capture points that could use more cover (it wouldn't be a DICE game if there was adequate cover!), but that's not a huge issue on this map. The center of the map offers a lot of infantry combat. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the best map in the expansion, and I've had a lot of good games on it.
