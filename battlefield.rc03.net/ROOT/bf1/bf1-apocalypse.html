			Absolutely beautiful map that is thoroughly ruined by Conquest Assault game mode. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The assaulting team is at a severe disadvantage here, and if the defending team is even remotely competent, then it will result in the assaulting team fighting for A for most of the round. Apocalypse has got to go down in history as one of the worst and lazy DLCs that DICE ever released. The community has requested DICE several times to offer conquest as an option ever since they released Turning Tides DLC, but instead of doing so, they went ahead and released two more maps in the Apocalypse DLC with Conquest Assault. 
		</p>
		<p>
			 Its a real shame too, because the map is beautiful and its designed well for the most part, but its absolutely not well balanced for the gamemode.

			The only conquest map in this expansion. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It has a very gritty aesthetic and this is the only map that suits the title of the expansion. IT is very reminiscent of the first single player mission. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The map is very infantry focused, and each side gets one task, and its restricted to the Landship. This is a design choice in Battlefield 1 that I am not particularly fond of. I feel we would be much better served without any restrictions on vehicle selection for the sake of authenticity. There is a larger conversation to be had about compromising fun for the sake of realism. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A different play styles are viable. Sniping with medium range rifles is a lot of fun, especially the Henry Martini. In certain situations it is possible for either of the sides to get spawn trapped, although I have not seen this happen too often. Overall, this is a fun map.

			Another maps lost to conquest assault game mode. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am not entirely sure who thought it was a good idea to have the assaulting team run across an open filed into a capture point without a lot of cover. Makes me wonder what kind of play testing a map goes through before it becomes public. River Somme would have been a fantastic map on conquest, but with the conquest assault game mode, it manages to be a grid lock for the most part, where the two teams clash at the very edge of the map. There are times when the round does not progress beyond the starting two points.
		</p>
		<p>
			I tend to play as a sniper on this map, because the other classes aren't as fun to play.

			I never played this map. Its unfortunate that DICE decided to ruin this expansion with conquest assault, and air assault maps.
