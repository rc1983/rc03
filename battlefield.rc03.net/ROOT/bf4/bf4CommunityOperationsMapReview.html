			This map is designed with a lot of community feedback, and there were some great ideas submitted, and also some awful ideas. I watched the development progress from a whitebox to the final version. It was a great experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The final result is a very well balanced map, that most infantry players would love. The temple area is very well designed. The forest area which is dense in the beginning but will get destroyed as the round progresses. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Tanks and LAVs are will keep vehicle players happy, but this is mostly catered towards infantry players. Assault and Support are the best classes on this map for me. Being an engineer was handy when there is a good tank driver around, or if I was driving the tank. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I thoroughly enjoyed this map. Its a fantastic effort by DICE.
