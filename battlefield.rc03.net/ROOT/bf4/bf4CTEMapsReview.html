			I had a lot of fun on this map, but I feel this map would not have been liked by the community especially if it was played in Normal Mode. 3D spotting would absolutely ruin the experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a very interesting take on this map, but I can understand why this was never released. It was a fun experiment. I had a lot of fun playing it in CTE in classic mode, but it was clear to me that it wouldn't work very well out in the public.

			I only ever played this map once in CTE, and I have no footage of it. I regret that because I felt it would be released soon, and I was waiting to play the finished version. Little did I know that it would die in CTE. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Like all night maps, this is best played in Classic Mode (without 3D spotting). It looks absolutely beautiful. There were talks about removing access to the high rises, and I felt that was a bad choice because its the high rises that seperate Siege of Shanghai from any random urban map. I couldn't wait to play in the center tower at night. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Sadly I will never get to experience that.

			This map should have been picked for Night Operations in my opinion. The presence of vehicles in night maps, combined with 3d spotting just doesn't work very well. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Combat on this map was very intense, and taclights are extremely viable attachments. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As a big fan of Peral Market, i so wish this map was available in the retail version of the game.
