			One of the most beautiful maps in the entire series. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There is plenty of infantry combat, long lines of sight for snipers, and attack boats can make a meaningful contribution. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I absolutely love the A flag setting. Playing as a recon with a spawn beacon, tugs, and a suppressed carbine is a lot of fun. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Choppers also get to do some work attacking the transport vehicles, and taking out snipers on the hills. Its a great map for all classes.

			A large beautiful map where attack boats and jets control the waters. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Taking off from a carrier towards the center of the map to fight some infantry battles is a lot of fun. Unlike Lost Islands, infantry can't do a whole lot on a couple of capture points because they are fairly open, and it is up to the attack boats to capture and hold these points.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The center is where all the action happens. The cover around C flag is not adequate, and it gets destroyed very easily. It requires a team effort to capture and hold this flag because of its open layout, and its visible from D and E flags. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I really like this map, and a few tweaks could have made this a whole lot better.

			Beautiful map with terrible performance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a real shame because I love the layout of this map. Both sides approach the central island from the sides, and fight to control the top, which is crucial for victory. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are land and sea vehicles on this map, but the top of the mountain is mostly infantry, but attack and transport choppers can be very useful. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem with the map is the performance. I've rarely played a round on this map without sevvere sturring issues. It was particular awful at launch, which is a shame because I love the layout and the gameplay it offers.

			This is the best map in the expansion for me. The interior of the submarine bay is so well done. That part alone could be a map in most FPS games. You could spend the entire round not leaving the interior bay. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you venture out of the submarine hangar, there is a gigantic open map, and it is possible climb up the hill that houses the hangar, and snipe at gunner on attack boats. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Choppers and boats play a major role in the outdoor areas. Boat combat is great for the most part. The attack chopper can be a powerful asset to the team that manages to get it. I have never been able to hold on to the chopper for too long. Its difficult to get a hold of it because it spawns out in the open and its an easy target. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The beautiful visuals and the excellent map design make this the best map in the expansion for me.
