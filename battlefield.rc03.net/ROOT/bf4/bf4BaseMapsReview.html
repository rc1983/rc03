		<p>
			Set in a futuristic city, with skyscrapers, this map starts out at the break of dawn and soon becomes day. I've always been partial to maps that take place in low light conditions, because I don't have to put up with Supernova Sun.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is plenty of vehicle and infantry combat. Taking out choppers with tanks, rooftop combat at B flag is something I enjoy a lot. After the levolution event, some underground tunnels become accessible, which can be used by infantry to navigate between capture points. This provides multiple flanking routes - sign of a well designed map.
		</p>
		<p>
			The MAA's existence has been questioned on this map, but I think skilled chopper pilots can navigate through the map taking cover behind buildings. What I never understood was the presence of jets on this map. They have a very limited impact on ground combat (may be a good thing).

		<!-- FLOOD ZONE -->
		<h2 id="fz" class="heading-color">Flood Zone</h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVxXrQ1W04E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br/>
		<p>
			This map set in a Chinese city, and it is a paradise for rooftop campers and little bird pilots, with plenty of tall buildings to choose from to either set up shop or take cover from stinger missiles. As much as everyone likes to hate rooftop campers, I think its a viable strategy if used correctly. I found that the best ways to counter those who are perched on the roof is by using either the XM25 Airburst or the transport chopper.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is one of those maps where the levolution really changes the ground combat. Once the event is triggered, the center of the map is flooded, and this allows for some great RHIB gameplay.
		</p>
		<p>
			Flood Zone mainly caters to infantry combat. The area around B and C flag is a maze and success requires good map knowledge. This is an excellent example of a 64 player map with vertical gameplay done right.

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQYZV_5axJc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br/>
		<p>
			Tanks, jets, choppers, MAAs, M142, and jeeps - all make an appearance here. This is one for the old school Battlefield players.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a lot of infantry combat around the A, B and C flags. This part of the map is like a Bad Company 2 map in itself. One could play an entire round of conquest and not venture away from this area. Vehicles dominate the rest of the map and snipers looking to get that 1000m headshot, and not help the team in the process, can camp far away in the hills.
		</p>
		<p>
			D flag on this map is actually the train itself, which moves from one side of the map to the other depending on which team is holding the flag. I think they should have allowed players to navigate within the train carts, but sadly that is not possible. It is however possible to run on top of the carts, Indiana Jones style!

		<!-- HINAN RESORT -->
		<h2 id="hr" class="heading-color">Hinan Resort</h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AT10oeKG4VI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br/>
		<p>
			The highlight of this map is of course the resort in the center. The levolution event involves demolishing different sections of the resort. Once triggered, a section collapses, and so does the game performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frame rate could dip below 20 FPS, and the collapsed section of the map is plagued by invisible walls.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I love the concept, and the ambitious design, I cannot ignore the problems. A patch released by DICE Sweden was supposed to have addressed some of the issues, but it seems to have made little to no difference. This map is a wasted opportunity in my opinion.

		<!-- OPERATION LOCKER -->
		<h2 id="ol" class="heading-color">Operation Locker</h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOm7w9Xl5JM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
		<p>
			Yet another missed opportunity here. They could have turned the prison section from the single player campaign into a multiplayer map. The single player level had a huge outdoor area, but that's nowhere to be seen in Operation Locker.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interior has a whole section of prison cells spanning multiple levels near the C flag that are not playable. A couple of entry points from the outside into the C flag would have made this map so much better, and it could have still been appealing to those who like to play Battlefield: Call of Duty.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead they went for a linear choke point design, which is only marginally better than Operation Metro.

		<!-- PARACEL STORM -->
		<h2 id="ps" class="heading-color">Paracel Storm</h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lk-DYX9hes" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></br>
		<p>
			This is an absolutely beautiful map, with a great levolution event, but it is ruined by the Commander mode. Fortunately, I played on servers that turned off Commander mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			A & B points are crucial to winning the game. I am not so sure that the MAA should have been tied to point B. Given the location of the point, infantry will gather there anyway. There are other parts of the map that are relatively unpopulated. An MAA would be a great asset to fight for. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Naval combat is excellent on this map. Attack boats can be very powerful. Its a well balanced map for all kinds of gameplay.

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWhNSPiSEgE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></br>
		<p>
			The dish in the center of the map is the most distinctive feature of this map. Many epic Battlefield moments took place on and around this structure. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My main complaint with this map again is the fact that the gunship and MAA are tied to the same point like in Paracel Storm. Leveloution would result in invisible walls, just like in Hainan Resort.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than these two issues, the maps plays out extremely well more often than not.

		<!-- SIEGE OF SHANGHAI -->

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHbQ5KD8UaI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></br>
		<p>
			The levolution event on this map is by far the best in Battlefield 4. It changes the map in many ways. The team controlling the tower has every reason to fight and make sure its not collapsed because it gives that team the ability to travel other capture points easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel this map is a great example of an urban battlefield. There is plenty of land combat and the attack boat is occasionally useful. I think this part of the gameplay was very under developed, but that didn't make the map less fun for me. Like most of the maps in the game, vertical gameplay is excellent. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Using a SRAW to take out a chopper from one of the rooftops is a great feeling.

		<p>
			Infantry combat at its best along with Flood Zone, but its more closer to my idea of a Battlefield map because of the presence of heavy armor. 
		</p>
		<p>
			While the destruction on this map is fantastic, it can lead to vehicles getting stuck on broken tree trunks, invisible walls between C & D flags.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is one of those rare maps that allow every class can be useful on this map provided the player goes for the objective.
