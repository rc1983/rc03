			The classic map from BF3 makes a return. DICE did the right thing and removed the blue filter that plagued most of the maps in BF3, and without it, the map looks beautiful. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Just about all the changes done to this map are positive. The environmental destruction, layout of the capture points, a wall with guard posts instead of the fence, are all excellent changes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There is plenty to do for both infantry and vehicles, which is a sign of a well balanced map. Overall, I think including this map in the expansion is a good idea. This is not something I can say about the rest of the maps in this DLC.

			This classic map from Battlefield 2 makes a return to Battlefield 4. It is the third time this map has been included in a major Battlefield game, and honestly I am not sure why. Its not a terrible map, but it is by no means special. Strike at Karkand would have been a much better choice. There are plenty of other maps in Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 3 that were better this...but DICE went with this instead...
		</p>
		<p>
			When this DLC was first released, I actually enjoyed this map quite a bit. I liked the long range sniping, and playing as a tanker is a lot of fun on this map, but there are certain aspects of it that appear to be under developed. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The attack boat doesn't have a whole lot to do, and the shallow waters on the west side of the map make it a pain to navigate. It is useful in keep the enemy attack chopper in check every now and then, but that's really it.  
		</p>
		<p>
			By far the most annoying feature of this map, is the storm. It was fun for a few rounds, and then the novelty wore off very quickly. It rolls in too early in the round, and it stays for the rest of the round. If it was something that was random, and it stayed for a minute or two, I would be fine with the idea. I just did not like the way it was implemented, and it made the map less fun for me.

			This map was a sniper pradise in Battlefield 3. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I think its a pretty solid map, but I am not sure it why it was picked. There were plenty of maps in Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 3 that were better than this. Markhaz Monolith (Aftermath), Wake Island (Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 3), Kubra Dam (Battlefield 2) to name a few, would have been better choices in my opinion. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I like how they changed the time of day setting on this map. In Battlefield 3, it was a sunny afternoon with the supernova sun, but in Battlefield 4, it appears to be dusk, and while there is plenty of light, there is no sun, which is excellent. Its balanced pretty well, and I haven't had too many lopsided games.

			I hate this map. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This map represents everything that is wrong with Battlefield. When I heard that DICE picked this abomination, ignoring many other maps that thoroughly deserved a remake, I was disappointed. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Its not just that that they picked Operation Metro, its that they did not address the problems with the older version. It is still unbalanced towards one side, and the few extra flanking routes they added don't have much of an impact on the gameplay, and the outdoor section is fairly useless because if the Russian team is fighting outdoors, it probably means they are losing.  
		</p>
		<p>
			This map would have benefited from 5 capture points and a non linear layout. This would have still offered great infantry combat without the choke point mess we currently have.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I am more disappointed that DICE wasted an opportunity to make a great infantry only map, and instead went for the low hanging fruit. The sad thing is, this is still not the worst Battlefield map.
