			I thought Zavod 311 was an excellent map. Its got a great mix of infantry and vehicle gameplay. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The night version however does not work very well in my experience. Out in the public, Normal Mode ruins the gameplay. There is no tactics involved. It is possible to snipe at long range because of 3d spotting. All you have to do is shoot at dorritos. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I definitely felt that the vehicles were out of place. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another bizzare design choice they made was removing the stair access to the tower at F. This meant the only way to get to the top was bvy a chopper. So if the idea is to prevent camping, why have choppers? I made no sense gameplay wise...
		</p>
		<p>
			I am glad DICE released free DLC to everyone, but from a gameplay perspective, this is not a great map for me.
